Generated by Bootstrap CLI.

## Overview

- **Backend**: {{ backend_type }}
- **Deploy**: {{ deploy_target }}

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `uv` (Python package manager)
- `go` (If using Go backend)
- `task` (Taskfile runner)
- `docker` (For local services)

### Setup

```bash
task setup
```

### Development

Start the development server and local services:

```bash
task dev
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
task test
```

## Architecture

This monorepo is designed to be polyglot and scalable.

### 1. Services & Apps `[apps/]` `[services/]`
*   **`services/`**: Backend microservices or the main monolith.
*   **`apps/`**: Client-side applications.
    *   `apps/cli`: Python-based CLI for management.
    *   *(Future)* `apps/web`: Next.js web application.
    *   *(Future)* `apps/ios`: Native Swift iOS application.

### 2. Shared Packages `[packages/]`
Code shared between apps and services lives here.
*   **`packages/api-client-python`**: Auto-generated Python client for your backend API (used by `apps/cli`).
*   *(Future)* **`packages/api-client-swift`**: Swift client for iOS.
*   *(Future)* **`packages/api-client-ts`**: TypeScript client for Web.

## Managing Components

### Installed by Default
When you run `bootstrap init`, you get:
*   A backend service (Python/Go).
*   A Python CLI (`apps/cli`).
*   Infrastructure config (Docker/Fly).
*   A shared API client package.

### Adding New Components
Use the `bootstrap` tool to expand your project.

#### Adding a Shared Package
Create a new shared library (e.g., for shared business logic, types, or utilities):

```bash
# Add a Python package
bootstrap add package my-core-lib --type python

# Add a Go package
bootstrap add package my-go-lib --type go
```

#### Adding an App (Coming Soon)
To add a new frontend or service:

```bash
bootstrap add component web  # Scaffolds Next.js
bootstrap add component ios  # Scaffolds iOS Swift App
```
